# SmartIDS
- An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software programme that watches for hostile activity or policy breaches on a network. They are used to detect anomalies in order to catch hackers before they cause serious network or device harm. Snort is a network intrusion detection and prevention system that is free and open source. Snort is used to track traffic entering and exiting a network. When it detects potentially harmful packets or threats on Internet Protocol (IP) networks, it monitors traffic in real time and logs in alerts for users.The challenge faced by users while deploying Snort is that it is command line and confusing to configure and use. Our Intrusion Detection System focuses on developing a unique application, with the aid of Snort, which takes into consideration the user comfort, and makes the traffic and threats easier to detect, analyze and mitigate with the help of a dashboard.
